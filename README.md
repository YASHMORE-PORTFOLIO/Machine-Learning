Collected extensive healthcare datasets from Kaggle and applied advanced data cleaning and transformation techniques to create high-quality inputs for predictive modeling.

The machine learning models that were developed and optimized for predicting critical health outcomes include stroke, heart attack, and chronic kidney disease, while the algorithms applied range from logistic regression, random forests, to gradient boosting.

It gave actionable insights while model performance was assessed, with the precisions, recall, and accuracies representing possibilities of decision enhancements in both healthcare and strategies of care.
